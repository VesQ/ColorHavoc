Information on how the mapfile (.coh) is built
===============================================

Header, bytes 1-128
-------------------

Bytes 1-3:
	Signature of the mapfile, string "CoH" (notice the small "o")
Bytes 4-16:
	String used to identify the version of the game this map was built on. 
	The leftover bytes are filled with spaces.
	E.g. "0.1          "
Bytes 17-32:
	Reserved for future use.
Bytes 33-64:
	The name of the map, with the leftover bytes filled with spaces.
	E.g. "The greatest map of all!        "
	Notice that the maximun length for a map name is 32 characters.
Bytes 65-96:
	Authors name, with the leftover bytes filled with spaces.
	E.g. "Vesa Laakso (VesQ)              "
	Notice that the maximun length for a map name is 32 characters.
Bytes 97-128:
	An MD5 hash of maps name, authors name and map data.
	E.g. "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"



Map data, bytes from 129 to EOF
-------------------------------
Each tile is represented with a chunk size of 16 bytes.


Byte 1: 
	The x-coordinate of a tile
Byte 2:
	The y-coordinate of a tile
Byte 3:
	The type of a tile
Byte 4:
	A bitmask used to save the start and exit directions from a block.
	1 = top, 2 = right, 4 = bottom, 8 = left
	E.g. "7" for top-right-bottom combination (1+2+4)
Bytes 5-13:
	The color of each part of the tile, starting from the upper left corner.
	See the color constants below.
Bytes 14-16:
	Reserved for future use.
